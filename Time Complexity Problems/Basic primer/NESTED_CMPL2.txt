What is the time complexity of the following code :

    int a = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = N; j > i; j--) {
            a = a + i + j;
        }
    }

Ans: O(N*N)

Reason:

1st for loop run n-1 time.
2nd  for loop run n(n-1) time;

T(n)= n-1+n*2 -n;
T(n)=n*2 -1;

O(n*2)
